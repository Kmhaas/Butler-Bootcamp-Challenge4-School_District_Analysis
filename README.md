# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview and Purpose
- Purpose: Maria has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
- Overview: Manipulate the data by using Python librarys, Pandas and juptyer notebook replace the scores for math and reading at Thomas High School for ninth graders. Then we will reuse that data to repopulate the school distrcit analysis to provide the new results.
